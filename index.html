</button>
<div class="panel">
                <p>Founded in 1937, USA Hockey provides the foundation for ice hockey in American and today includes more than one million players, coaches, officials, and volunteers. We are the official representative to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation. In this role, we organize and train teams for international competitions, including the IIHF World Championships, the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. We also work closely with the National Hockey League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the American Development Model (ADM)?
</button>
<div class="panel">
                <p>USA Hockey launched the American Development Model in 2009, providing a framework for optimal athlete development. Since then, USA Hockey has continued to build upon the framework, implementing best practices nationwide through a network of volunteers, in order to ensure that every child has the opportunity to experience fun in hockey. By giving your child the USA Hockey experience, you’re setting them up for long term success. It’s proven programming, built on research and data from leading hockey nations, sport scientists, coaches, and educators. As the parent of a USA Hockey athlete, you know that your coach has underwent Coaching Education Program training, and that they have learned and been trained with our extensive resources. You also know officials at your games have been trained and passed the USA Hockey rules test, and that your coach and any adults with your team have been SafeSport trained and have passed a background check. The foundation we’ve created for ice hockey gives parents the confidence that their child is having a fun and safe sports experience possible. Hockey is fun. USA Hockey believes in letting kids be kids. We believe that kids and their families should get the most out of hockey without feeling undue performance or financial pressure. We believe in community-based youth hockey. We believe in keeping kids engaged, moving, and smiling. We believe in creating a safe and fun environment that is welcoming to everyone. We believe in making optimal use of ice time. We believe in creating great athletes, not just hockey players. USA Hockey believes your family will enjoy the mental, social, and physical well-being that hockey offers.</p>
